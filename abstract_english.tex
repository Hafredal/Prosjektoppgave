To maintain awareness of colleagues' work is essential for good coordination. Nurses receive information necessary to maintain such awareness through external interrupts. These disruptions, in addition to the already interrupted-driven environment they work in.
This research paper looks at the nurse call system at St. Olav's Hospital in Trondheim. We have seen how this works today, how nurses maintain awareness at work item and how it interrupted-driven environment affects their work.
